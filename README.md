### Horizotal Scaling

In Cosmos DB, horizontal scaling is achieved through the concept of partitions. A partition is a unit of distribution and scalability in Cosmos DB, and it represents a subset of your data stored in a collection. By partitioning your data, you can distribute it across multiple physical partitions, allowing for parallel processing and improved performance.
